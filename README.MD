#Documentation

the source in ORIGINAL_WORKING_MOSTLY worked, mostly, but that was ca. meteor v0.9.  Now there are issues.

Need is to (1) make it work, and (2) create an admin dashboard that (a) allows you to enter new emails, set times for delivery (in the email simulator) , and (b) that I can add to analytics to later, etc.
